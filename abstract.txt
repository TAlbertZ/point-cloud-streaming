context:
In recent years, the development of devices for acquisition and
rendering of 3D contents have facilitated the diffusion of immersive
virtual reality experiences. 

In particular, the point cloud representa-
tion has emerged as a popular format for volumetric photorealistic
reconstructions of dynamic real world objects, due to its simplicity
and versatility.

Volumetric media, popularly known as
holograms, need to be delivered to users using both on-
demand and live streaming, for new augmented reality (AR)
and virtual reality (VR) experiences.

Volumetric videos are truly 3D, allow-
ing six degrees of freedom (6DoF) movement for their viewers
during playback. Such flexibility enables numerous applications
in entertainment, healthcare, education, etc.

High-quality point clouds have recently gained interest as an emerg-
ing form of representing immersive 3D graphics.

These days, the emerging devices and softwares for acquiring and rendering 3D media have made the promising immersive applications in 5G/6G era such as Virtual/Augmented Reality more and more practical and portable. Particularly, on-demand volumetric video, which allows six degrees of freedom (DoF) user movement in playback, facilitates many fields including education, enteretainment, etc. Among all the volumetric formats, Point Cloud becomes the most popular one because of its flexibility and simplicity. However, Point Cloud video streaming is more challenging than 2D video streaming as well as 360 video streaming to enable good quality of experience during playback, because it has more data to be transmitted, more DoF, and .
